            <h2>WHAT WAS THE OBJECTIVE OF MY BOOK?</h2>
            <p>The objective of my book was to raise awareness about terrorism. <BR> Another objective I wanted to focus towards was to make sure that people get the message and awareness is raised around the world to make sure terrorism stops. <br> Apart from that I wrote this book as I love to read as well as write books after this usmmative assesment. <br> This book is a action packed book as well its genre is all about freedom and the rights to live and the rights to have the freedom of speech. </p>

              <h2>WHO WAS THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR MY BOOK</h2>
              The target audience for my book was mostly 3, 4, 5, 6 & 7 grade. <br> Since alot of people in those grades like action movies I would happily like to address them for my book and summative assesment.<BR> Like mentioned before this is an action based book and only the juniors would like to read it since its the genre that they prefer...
