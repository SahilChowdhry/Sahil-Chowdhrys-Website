            <h2>WHAT WAS THE OBJECTIVE OF MY GAME </h2>
            <p>The objective of my game was to make sure that my peers and my juniors are good at math as well as my game would be more succesful and helpful for my peers. <br> My game involves addition, mulitiplication, substraction and division and it is also a 1 word answer on the basis of the question. (Question and Answers)<br> The main objective of this unit was to make sure that the coding of my website is functional as well as it is helpful for the teachers that are teaching the students. <br> In this generation a lot of children like to use screens rather than using a pencil and a paper and that is why I think making a online game is an advantage.</p>

            <h2>WHO WAS THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR MY GAME?</h2>
          </p>My main target audience for this unit was my juniors  (Mostly 3, 4, 5, 6, & 7 graders who are either weak in maths or they need extra practice and efforts for their summative) Apart from that this also for teachers to use as a reasource for their children as the link works multiple times as well as the question ranges from multiplication, addition, substraction and divison. Like mentioned before the website is helpful as its online rather than writing on a pencil and a piece of paper.Â </p>

                <h2> WHAT ARE THE MAIN DISADVANTAGES AND ADVANTAGES?</h2>
                <p>The website barely has any disadvantages except sometimes due to high rates of people playing at one time the website can bug as well as your laptop or the game might start to hang. <BR> Another disadvantage is that students might get addicted to this game, therefore my target audience can also get health issues such as the risk of possibly getting glasses. <br> Some advantages are, since this is a game based by coding the teacher and the student has an easier job and hence things go smoother than they are. <br> With that being said another advantage is that since its online its conserves time and therefore the student can have a lot of class time to work on their mathematic skills. </p>
